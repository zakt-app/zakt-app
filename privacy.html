               </p>
               <p>
                  We may use information you submit in a public forum (e.g. a blog, chat room, or

                  by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform
                  to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Zakt or the

                  information about you in connection with, or during negotiations of, any
                  reorganization, dissolution, restructuring, merger, sale of company assets,
                  financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to a buyer or other
                  successor, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or
                  similar proceeding, in which personal information held by Zakt about the users of
                  our Services is among the assets transferred.
               </p>

                  We may also share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably

                  about our users and their usage. The anonymous aggregated data that we may collect
                  could be used in a variety of ways, including but not limited to, improving the
                  performance of our Services. We may also, in the future, share such aggregated,
                  anonymous information with third-party partners. By using our services, you are

                  interest to you.
               </p>

               <h4>Security of Your Personal Information</h4>
               <p>
                  Personal information within user accounts, including transaction history, is
                  protected by a password for your privacy and security. The Company employs
                  numerous administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to assist in
                  protecting the personal information we collect against accidental, unlawful or
                  unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.
               </p>
               <p>
                  We further suggest that all users safeguard their own account username and
                  password and not share that information with anyone. If users are concerned about
                  misuse of their identity within the Services, or are using a shared device, users
                  should make an effort to log out as often as necessary. We will never ask for your
                  password via email and users should report any such inquiry.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Note. Zakt meets or exceeds the standards generally accepted by the industry
                  within which it operates in regards to the protection of personal information.
                  However, no electronic transmission of information can be executed with absolute
                  certainty that a failure or breach will not occur. Company cannot guarantee that
                  the security measures in place to safeguard personal information will never be
                  defeated or fail, or that those measures will always be sufficient or effective.
               </p>
