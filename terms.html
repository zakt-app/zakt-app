               <h4>Termination</h4>
               <p>
                  Zakt reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to the
                  Services or any portion thereof at any time, without notice. To the maximum extent
                  permitted by law, this agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware
                  and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in
                  Delaware in all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the Services.
                  Use of the Services is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect
                  to all provisions of these Terms, including, without limitation, this section.
               </p>
               <p>
                  ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE
                  TERMS OF USE, OR THE SERVICES MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE

                  BARRED.
               </p>
               <p>
                  You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship
                  exists between you and Zakt as a result of this agreement or use of the Services.
                  Zakt’s performance of this agreement is subject to existing laws and legal
                  process, and nothing contained in this agreement is in derogation of Zakt's right
                  to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or requirements
                  relating to your use of the Services or information provided to or gathered by
                  Zakt with respect to such use. If any part of this agreement is determined to be
                  invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to,
                  the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the
                  invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid,
                  enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original
                  provision and the remainder of the agreement shall continue in effect.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement constitutes the entire agreement
                  between the user and Zakt with respect to the Services and it supersedes all prior
                  or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or
                  written, between the user and Zakt with respect to the Services. A printed version
                  of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible
                  in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement
                  to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents
                  and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. It is the express
                  wish to the parties that this agreement and all related documents be written in
                  English.
               </p>
